# babys_1st_python_package
my first attempt at making a python package.

I'm following a guide from my opensource development class, it's repo can be found here: https://github.com/Insper/open-dev 

This package shows the most recent commit in the course's github repo.

the pip can be installed with: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dev-aberto-jj==0.1
